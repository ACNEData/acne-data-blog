## How-to

### Drafts

Drafts for new posts can be placed in `_drafts`.

A post is simply a markdown file ending in `.md`. It is important however to add the
following front matter to the beginning of the file. The title is just replaced with
the respective post title.

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Example title"
---
```

### Publish

Once the post is ready to be published, the publishing date needs to be prepended to
the filename in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-filename.md`. It can then be simply moved 
to `_posts`.
