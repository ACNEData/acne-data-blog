        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
        <p>We are ACNE Data. The latest addition to the ACNE Family in the continuing mission to push what it means to be a creative agency in a world where the only constant is change. Our vision is to become the leading agency in Sweden in the field of creative data innovation. In this first issue of a series of letters, we want to talk about what we believe we will add to the agency. We would also like to share what it means, for ourselves and our clients, to become a data-driven organization.</p>
        <p>Becoming a data-driven organization is a collaborative effort that involves shifts in perspective and adoption of new methods. At its core, this adoption is an iterative process not a disruptive one. We are all already data-driven beings. Someone&#39;s favourite food being lasagna, because that’s what their mom always cooked. Their fear of dogs because of that nasty neighbor&#39;s beast that bit them as a child. These are all examples of the mind integrating data of your everyday experiences into a model to facilitate decisions in everyday life ‘the savanna’, ensuring their survival. But today we find ourselves in an environment of information and decisions that we simply did not evolve for (yet). This is where a systematic and rigorous approach to data is the next logical evolutionary step, helping us to make sense of all the information and ultimately, to help us make decisions. In essence, becoming data-driven means adopting the most powerful invention in human history, the scientific method, which really, is nothing more than a formulated approach to learning through play and exploration, backed by logic, data, and statistics. This means asking the right questions first and then turning to the data with the right methodology to find answers. In a business setting, asking the right question means to identify what decision needs to be made.</p>
        <p>As an organization, we need to know first what the unknowns are before we can address them by putting them into the spotlight of investigation. Looking through data without a question in mind, while it can lead to interesting discoveries, is ultimately wasteful in how many resources it binds up. Tesla, proclaimed leader in self-driving cars, could constantly collect petabytes of video data from its fleet of cars. Instead, the fleet is instructed to only send data over in certain events, for example when the self-driving system disengages, because ultimately, that’s where the signal in the data is the highest. This is decision-driven data science.</p>
        <p>Data science is not a job, it’s a set of habits we all share: It’s being skeptical, it’s to collaborate, it’s to communicate, it’s to fundamentally understand the problem we are trying to solve, it’s to ask open ended questions, it’s to be curious, to be open to change and to update your opinions and beliefs, it’s to learn and explore. One of our guiding principles is to not merely be a silo or support function but to be cross functional, to teach and to learn. It is on this common ground of habits, that we believe we can build a fruitful collaboration, to transform ACNE into a data-driven agency at the crossroads of art and science.</p>
        <p>Data is not purposeful on its own, the creative process infuses purpose and life into data. Serendipitously, the creative process works best when there are some constraints present, a framework or canvas. The great masters deliberately chose and studied different methods of painting to guide their creative process along a certain path. In this wonderful feedback loop, data can provide scaffolding for creativity to grow around and maybe even free the creative process from the personal preferences of a client. It helps to reframe the conversation from ‘I think’ to ‘I know’. It has never been ‘data vs creativity’ but ‘data x creativity’. What is my audience / target group? Which of my designs engages the best with my audience? Does this messaging have the intended effect? All these questions and more that we encounter in the creative process on daily agency life, data can help us answer. Technologies under the umbrella term of ‘Creative AI’ also open new avenues of creativity and allow us to explore the human condition in new ways. In summary, data is fuel to make good decisions and to ‘move the needle’. For a creative agency this means data is fuel to move people&#39;s emotions.</p>
        <p>To circle back to our savanna origin, data is not the opposite of gut feeling, it’s the evolution of gut feeling. If we employ data science with rigour, we can trust the process and the result just the way we used to trust our gut feeling and we will be pointed in the right direction. Data is updating our beliefs, data is updating our gut feeling. Afterall, our gut hosts a cat brain worth of neurons, it would be a shame if we would entirely cut it out of our thought and decision making process.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to fruitful collaboration,</p>
        <p>ACNE Data</p>
